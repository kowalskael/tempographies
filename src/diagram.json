        "description": "Biochar is the solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass (for ex. olive tree branches) in an oxygen-limited environment and is a form of charcoal, made of carbon and ashes, remaining after the pyrolysis of biomass. It is a stable solid and can endure in soil for thousands of years. Biochar is treated in the UHA\/CNRS laboratory using cold plasma to enrich it with nitrogen molecules and transform it into soil amendment. The important question in research is: what biochar is?",

Is biochar a solution to recycle biowaste in a sustainable way? What is it as a social concept?",

        "description": "Biochar granulometry is a measurement of the size distribution of biochar particles. Different methods of biochar production and treatment result in different sizes of biochar particles. Granulation level is not connected with quality of biochar for the project: using smaller particles improves resolution of extreme surface measurements done in the UHA\/CNRS laboratory but when using bigger particles the resolution of extreme surface measurements rapidly falls. Moreover, mixing biochar with sufficiently large grains with the soil means that the physical properties of such a mixture (e.g. greater aeration) must be taken into account in the plant growth process.",
