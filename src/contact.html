                <div class="h2">Considering the targets of EUGD for a 20% reduction of chemical fertilizers by 2030,
                    it is essential to optimize nutrient use and recovery. Biowaste recycling and nutrient
                    recovery is highly promoted, however their fertilizing potential and social acceptance
                    must improve in a sustainable, efficient and safe approach.</div>
                <div class="text">The project will provide a scientific cooperation framework among different disciplines
                    targeting the process of developing a novel fertilizer from the raw waste material to a
                    final application. It will also explore social aspects of scientific practice,
                    human/non-human actors and interactions between them. Creation of a specially designed
                    digital media environment will help to visualize crucial temporal, spatial, ecological,
                    and cultural transformations involved in the process of trans-European scientific collaboration.
                    It will combine the knowledge of the five ECRs involved in the thematic of biowastes processing
                    (Stuttgart), materials functionalization (UHA), environmental analysis (AUTh), art and science
                    research (AMU) and culture and technology studies (AMU). The project will provide a platform
                    for personal and scientific advancement of the participating ECRs, not only to tackle a pressing
                    societal problem, but also to initiate a collaboration for further interdisciplinary
                    investigations.</div>
