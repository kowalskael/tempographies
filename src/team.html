                        is a Professor at the University of Stuttgart. The last 3 years she has
                        been focusing on Phosphorus recycling from biogenic residues, sewage sludge,
                        poultry manure and biomass wastes. She worked on the following 2 Projects:
                        ‘CALMOD’ focusing on phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge combustion and
                        ‘Plants fit for Future’ on Genetic modification of plants in order to be able
                        to survive in starving and drought conditions for utilizing/ mobilizing biochar
                        as P source. <br><br>

                        is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Haute- Alsace/CNRS since 2020.
                        He has a solid formation in materials science and surface functionalization. His
                        PhD work, concluded in 2019 in the University of Freiburg, involved the
                        exploitation and functionalization of biomass in the development of new
                        materials. His research at UHA is focused on the functionalization of surfaces
                        through plasma assisted processes, especially with bio-sourced precursors.

                        Elżbieta Kowalska is a PhD student, designer and artist based in Poland.
                        Her research examines the intersections between coded spaces, visual language,
                        art, design and politics. In her practice Elżbieta works with feminist,
                        critical and anti-colonial methodologies seeking to understand how technologies
                        such as geographic information systems and digital mapping are imagined,
                        constructed and operated, and how they influence the world and social
                        imaginations.<br><br>
